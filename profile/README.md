# Uroria Minecraft Network

**Welcome to Uroria!**

**Here are all our projects**, *exclusively intended* for Uroria, and therefore,
support for other use cases is not provided.
However, we welcome _pull requests_, and _contributing_ in this manner can lead to earning certain **in-game rewards**.
This feature will come soon, so stay tuned and **join [our Discord](https://dc.uroria.com)** to **not miss any news**.

**We don't provide a public package repository**, so you will need to create your own for the usage of libraries.
